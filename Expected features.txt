🔹 1. Add New Crime Case

Add details like:

Crime ID

Area

Type (Murder / Theft / Robbery / Fraud)

Suspect name

Date

Description

Store it in a list (and file).
🧩 Concepts: Classes, Encapsulation, Constructors, File I/O

🔹 2. Display All Crimes

Show all recorded crimes with their details.

Display crimes differently depending on the type (uses polymorphism).
🧩 Concepts: Inheritance, Polymorphism, Loops, Conditions

🔹 3. Search Crime by Area

User enters an area → program shows all crimes from that area.
🧩 Concepts: Loops, Conditions, Encapsulation (getter method)

🔹 4. Update Crime Status

Each case has a status (“Pending”, “Solved”, “Under Investigation”).

User can update the status later.
🧩 Concepts: Encapsulation (setters/getters), Conditions

🔹 5. Crime Statistics Report

Display:

Total crimes recorded

Crimes by type (e.g., 4 thefts, 2 murders)

Area with the most crimes
🧩 Concepts: Loops, Counters, Conditional Logic

🔹 6. Save & Load Data (File Handling)

Automatically save crimes to a file.

Load saved data at the start of the program.
🧩 Concepts: File I/O, Constructors/Destructors (optional)

🔹 7. Search by Suspect Name

Enter suspect name → show all crimes linked to that person.
🧩 Concepts: Encapsulation, String comparison, Loop

🔹 8. Area Safety Rating (Simple)

Program counts crimes in each area.

Fewer crimes → “Safe Area”, more crimes → “High Risk Area”.
🧩 Concepts: Loops, Conditions, Basic Logic

🔹 9. Delete Crime Record

Allow the user to remove a record using the Crime ID.

Confirms before deleting: “Are you sure you want to delete this record (Y/N)?”
🧩 Concepts: Loops, Conditions, File Overwriting, Encapsulation

🔹 10. Case Sorting System

Sort crimes by:

Date

Area

Type

Use basic sorting (e.g., bubble sort or selection sort).
🧩 Concepts: Loops, Conditions, Arrays/Lists, Sorting Algorithm

🔹 11. Crime Type Filtering

User chooses “Show only Murders” or “Show only Robberies.”

Displays filtered results only.
🧩 Concepts: Polymorphism, Conditions, Loops

🔹 12. Crime Severity Level

Each crime has a severity score (1–5) based on type:
e.g., Murder = 5, Theft = 2, Fraud = 1

Show average severity across all crimes.
🧩 Concepts: Class attributes, Conditions, Loops, Basic math logic

🔹 13. Officer Assignment System

Assign a police officer name or ID to each case.

Later, search crimes handled by a specific officer.
🧩 Concepts: Composition (object inside another class), Encapsulation

🔹 14. Crime Status Summary

Show how many cases are:

Pending

Solved

Under Investigation
🧩 Concepts: Loops, Counters, Conditional Logic

🔹 15. Update Suspect Information

Edit suspect name or details for an existing crime.
🧩 Concepts: Encapsulation (setters), Conditions, Loops

🔹 16. Most Active Suspect

If the same suspect appears in multiple crimes → mark as “Repeat Offender.”
🧩 Concepts: Loops, String Comparison, Counters

🔹 17. View Crimes by Date Range

Input: start date and end date.

Display only crimes within that range.
🧩 Concepts: Loops, Conditions, Basic date comparison

🔹 18. Generate Text Report

Option to export all data (or filtered results) into a .txt file report.

Example: “Karachi_Crime_Report_Nov2025.txt”
🧩 Concepts: File Handling, Loops, Conditions

🔹 19. Crime Pattern Detector (Simple Version)

If multiple crimes occur in same area or type → print:
“⚠️ Pattern Detected: High number of thefts in Saddar.”
🧩 Concepts: Loops, Counters, Conditional Logic
